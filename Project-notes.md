# Project Notes

Here are some obstacles I've run into while creating this project and the ways I've overcome them. I'm also including features I'd like to add in the future, reasons behind design decisions, as well as links to various resources and tools for others to discover and begin using :smile:

### Breakdown

The JSON data has question objects inside an array.

Each object has the question itself, the incorrect answers in an array and the correct answer as properties.

#### To-do:

1. Figure out how to display the questions on the screen

### Challenges

I'm not a professional designer. But I definitely found myself wanting a certain simple look to the application. Google and W3schools came in clutch a lot of the time when it came to styling.

### Design Thoughts

I'd like to keep the design as minimal and clean as possible. Each question will be displayed on a card. I want to add transitional animations whenever an action occurs, although that will depend on how much time I have left to finish the challenge.
